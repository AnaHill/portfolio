## Projects

### DatAnalyzer: The correct way to analyze FP signals
Codes and scientific paper freely available
- [DatAnalyzer home page](https://github.com/AnaHill/DatAnalyzer)  
- Publication _Opinion: The correct way to analyze FP signals_ available in [Zenodo](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.10205591)

Tools: **MATLAB**

Developed method and tool (DatAnalyzer) to analyze field potential (FP) signals from 2D human induced pluripotent stem cells derived cardiomyocyte (hiPSC-CM) cultures. I summarized how FP signals have been analyzed various, sometimes even contradictory, ways in the literature, and proposed my own methdod that could be considered.

### Write LaTeX documents together with co-authors that use MS Word
Project [page](https://github.com/AnaHill/Write-LaTeX-documents-using-Word) explains how to use this tool

Tools: **Powershell**, **Pandoc**, **LaTeX**, **Markdown**

Do you want to use LaTeX for you (scientific) paper, but struggling when co-authors, such as you supervisor, do not use it, and therefore Word is preferred? This is tool for you! Minimize hasszle of exporting files in different formats and copy-paste text from one format to another, while still be able to write LaTeX-documents and publish high-quality papers.

For example, this paper freely available [here](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10242335) was written using this tool.
